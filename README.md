Creating an app that is similar to sites like https://www.tapology.com/ or https://www.sherdog.com/ when it would list more events
it entails having fight events that are interactable, with fighters being within the events(stretch), fighters having a profile you can see more details(stretch) such as
record, amount of KO/Submission/Decision wins/losses, whether it was a title fight or not, fighter info(name, location, age, reach, height,  fight team)

basic requirements:
-sign up/sign in/ sign out
-users should not be able to access the rest of the site without signing up/signing in
-users should be able to create/update/delete events 
-user should NOT be able to edit/delete events that others have created
-logging in leads to your profile page
-event page should list all events regardless of who made them
-protected(hashed) passwords

for the future:
-user profile updates, edits
-saw pillow was something to download for images
-fighter index, with a page leading you to lists of current fights
-landing page with fighter of the day, next upcoming event akin to tapology:

-adding fighters to events, removing them from events as needed
-possibly showing why a fighter was removed(i.e injury)


some of the basic ideas for the front end:
